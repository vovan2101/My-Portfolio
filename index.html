            <div class="about-me">
                <p>Hello everybody! My name is Vlad, I am 22 years old and I was born in Russia. I came to the USA, when I was 15 years old. Here, in California, I gruate high school and went to the college to learn business and management. I really love business and management, but I really don't like the way college teach, so I quit.<br>After two years pause from studing, I dicide to try programming. I started to learn programming about 5 month ago. I learned it by myself and find it interesting to me, so decide go to the bootcamp. I find Coding temple best option for me, because here is actually what I want to learn and most of the stuff that we will learn, I familiar with. I use to deal with HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Python Django, so hopefully my small experience will help me to graduate Coding Temple.  </p>

                <p class="card-body">Soccer is very big part of my life. Before I came to the USA, I didn't really played soccer, but in California, I finded out, that soccer is my favourite thing to do ever. in my high school years, I really tried to do professional soccer. I was in a lot of different tryouts, buy my best result was a varsity high school team, which is not bad. Right now, I just playing soccer for fun.  </p>

                <p class="card-body">I am into gaming for all my life. When I was about 6 years old, I got my first PC, so I played games a lot. That is actually kind of sad, that I never tried programming, when I was a kid, but atleast I got a lot of experience with computer, which is helping me right now.</p>

                <p class="card-body">My goal is, to finish Coding Temple, so I will be able to find a job in programming. After that, I really want to work by distance, and live in Russia. When that happen, I will be the most happy person in the world, so I am trying hard to achieve my goal. Also, in Russia, I hang out with my best friends and playing much more soccer there. </p>
